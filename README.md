# Readable code exercise

##about

This exercise is all about cleaning up code and making sure it's easier to read, understand, and tweak in the future.

The original script was a little script that would order pizzas for people and send them to their location.
simplified and simulated, of course, no real pizzas were sent in the writing of this code

The focus lies in
* better naming of variables and functions
* simplifying logic while retaining readability
* adding type hinting and comments
* using PSR12 writing standards
* bit of a personal touch: adding some classes to improve the flow

##DONE

- [x] improved naming conventions of variables
- [x] improved naming conventions of functions
- [x] simplified and improved if/else chains (use switch and match where appropriate, or other solutions)
- [x] removing redundant logic
- [x] string concatenation consistency
- [x] add class-level docblocks 
- [x] add function-level docblocks
- [ ] put all info that should be connected in its own object/class for easy access
- [ ] remove deprecated functions that are only there to retain some insight into the original functionality
- [ ] other
